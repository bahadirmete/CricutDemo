Hello,

I have completed the demo and am sharing it here. All features are working as you described. If you have any questions, Iâ€™d be happy to discuss.

I realized later that I should have shared it via Git. Then I could have added the features step by step with proper commits. Sorry about that.

I also added a test for the ViewModel.

Thank you.
